  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.

        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global binding 
    - when 'this' keyword is called within global scope, it will refer to the global/window object.
  2. Implicit binding 
    - when 'this' keyword is called within a method of an object, this will refer to the object itself (what's left of the dot when function is invoked)
  3. Explicit binding
    - Using call, apply, or bind method, an object can be explicitly referred when 'this' keyword is used insdie a function.
  4. New binding
    - When 'new' keyword, in conjunction with a constructor function, is used to create an instance of an object, 'this' keyword will be referred to that object instance.
